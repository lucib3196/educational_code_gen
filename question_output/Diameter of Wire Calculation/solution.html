        Problem Statement:
        <p>The objective is to determine the diameter of a wire with a circular cross-section that is subjected to a tensile force of {params.force} {params.unitsForce}, resulting in a stress of {params.stress} {params.unitsStress} in the wire.</p>

        Known Variables Description:
        <ul>
            <li>Tensile force, \( F = {params.force} \, \text{{params.unitsForce}} \)</li>
            <li>Stress, \( \sigma = {params.stress} \, \text{{params.unitsStress}} \)</li>

        Equation Setup:
        <p>Stress is defined as force per unit area:</p>
        \[ \sigma = \frac{F}{A} \]
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\( \sigma \) is the stress,</li>
            <li>\( F \) is the force,</li>
            <li>\( A \) is the cross-sectional area.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a wire with a circular cross-section, the area \( A \) is given by:</p>
        \[ A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \]

        Solution Process:
        <ol>
            <li>Convert the stress from {params.unitsStress} to Pa (if necessary):</li>
            \[ \sigma = {params.stress} \, \text{{params.unitsStress}} \]
            <li>Rearrange the stress formula to solve for area \( A \):</li>
            \[ A = \frac{F}{\sigma} \]
            <li>Substitute the known values of \( F \) and \( \sigma \) to find \( A \):</li>
            \[ A = \frac{{params.force}}{{params.stress}} \, \text{m}^2 \] <!-- Adjusted for dynamic content, assuming conversion to SI units is handled elsewhere if needed -->
            <li>Use the formula for the area of a circle to solve for \( d \):</li>
            \[ A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \]
            <li>Rearrange to solve for \( d^2 \):</li>
            \[ d^2 = \frac{A \times 4}{\pi} \]
            <li>Take the square root to find the diameter \( d \):</li>
            \[ d = \sqrt{\frac{A \times 4}{\pi}} \] <!-- Note: A is calculated dynamically, so this step assumes A's value is inserted correctly -->

        Explanation and Clarification:
        <p>The problem involves basic principles of mechanics of materials, specifically the relationship between stress, force, and area. The stress is calculated by dividing the force by the area over which it is applied. Since the wire has a circular cross-section, the area is expressed in terms of the diameter. The final step involves algebraic manipulation to isolate the diameter and then taking the square root to solve for it.</p>

        Educational Goal:
        <p>The guide aims to help understand the relationship between force, stress, and cross-sectional area in a material under tension. It also demonstrates how to manipulate equations to isolate and solve for a desired variable, in this case, the diameter of a wire, which is {correct_answers.diameter} {params.unitsDistance}.</p>
