    <p>
        To determine the net force acting on the pilot under different acceleration conditions, we will be applying
        Newton's second law of motion. This problem requires an understanding of how mass, acceleration, and
        gravitational forces interact.

    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">
        Start by recalling Newton's second law of motion: the force is the product of an object's mass and its
        acceleration (\(F = m \times a\)).
    </pl-hint>

    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
        The problem specifies that the pilot's acceleration is a multiple of Earth's gravitational acceleration. Thus,
        \(a\) can be represented as \(a = {params.a} \times g\), where \(g\) is the gravitational acceleration (\(g =
        {units.gravitationalAcceleration} \, \text{{params.unitsAcceleration}}\)).
    </pl-hint>

    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        Subsequently, the formula for net force becomes \(F = m \times a = m \times ({params.a} \times g)\). Given our
        parameters, this translates to \(F = {params.mass} \, \text{{params.unitsMass}} \times ({params.a} \times
        {units.gravitationalAcceleration} \, \text{{params.unitsAcceleration}})\).
    </pl-hint>

    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        Now, let's plug in our known values: \(F = {params.mass} \times {params.a} \times
        {units.gravitationalAcceleration}\). This operation will determine the net force based on the accelerating
        conditions and mass of the object.

    <pl-hint level="5" data-type="text">
        After performing the calculation with the given parameters, the net force acting on the pilot amounts to
        <strong>\(F = {correct_answers.F} \, \text{{params.unitsForce}}\)</strong>. This is the net force required to
        initiate the motion as per the provided conditions.
