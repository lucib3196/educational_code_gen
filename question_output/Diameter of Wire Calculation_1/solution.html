    <!-- Introduction -->
    <pl-hint level="1" data-type="text">
        The objective is to determine the diameter of a wire with a circular cross-section that is subjected to a tensile force of ${{params.tensileForce}} \, {{params.unitsForce}}$, resulting in a stress of ${{params.stress}} \, {{params.unitsStress}}$ in the wire. Understanding the relationship between force, stress, and area is crucial in material science and engineering.

        <strong>Known Variables Description:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Tensile force, \( F = {{params.tensileForce}} \, {{params.unitsForce}} \)</li>
            <li>Stress, \( \sigma = {{params.stress}} \, {{params.unitsStress}} \)</li>

    <!-- Equation Setup -->
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        <strong>Equation Setup:</strong>
        Stress is defined as force per unit area:
        \[ \sigma = \frac{F}{A} \]
        The cross-sectional area of a wire with a circular cross-section is given by:
        \[ A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \]
        Where:
        <ul>
            <li>\( A \) is the cross-sectional area,</li>
            <li>\( d \) is the diameter of the wire.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Solution Process -->
    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        <strong>Solution Process:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Convert the stress from ${{params.unitsStress}} to Pascals for uniform calculations.</li>
            <li>Rearrange the stress formula to solve for the area \( A \):
            \[ A = \frac{F}{\sigma} \]</li>
            <li>Substitute the known values of \( F \) and \( \sigma \) to find \( A \).</li>
            <li>Use the formula for the cross-sectional area of a circular wire to solve for \( d^2 \):
            \[ A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \]</li>
            <li>Substitute the value of \( A \) and solve for \( d^2 \):
            \[ d^2 = \frac{4A}{\pi} \]</li>
            <li>Take the square root of both sides to solve for \( d \):
            \[ d = \sqrt{\frac{4A}{\pi}} \]</li>
        </ol>
