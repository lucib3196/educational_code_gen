    <p>To solve the problem, we follow these steps systematically. Pay attention to how each step builds upon the previous one.</p>

        First, we need to understand the formula for distance with constant acceleration: \( d = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \), where \( d \) is the distance, \( v_i \) is the initial velocity, \( t \) is the time in seconds, and \( a \) is the acceleration. This will be our foundational equation.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="2" data-type="text">
        To find the necessary acceleration for a given braking distance, we use the formula \( a = \frac{v^2}{2d} \), where \( v \) is the initial velocity and \( d \) is the specified braking distance. This will help us deduce the car's deceleration.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="3" data-type="text">
        Given the initial velocity of the car as \( v = {{params.v1}} {{params.unitsSpeed}} \) and the braking distance as \( d = {{params.d1}} {{params.unitsDist}} \), we substitute these values to find the acceleration \( a \).
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="4" data-type="text">
        With the identified acceleration, initial speed \( v_i = {{params.v1}} {{params.unitsSpeed}} \), and the time period \( t = {{params.t1}} {{params.unitsTime}} \), we return to our primary equation to find the total distance traveled.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint level="5" data-type="text">
        Inserting the known values into our equation, the distance the car travels in {{params.t1}} {{params.unitsTime}} is calculated to be \( {correct_answers.d} {{params.unitsDist}} \). This completes our problem-solving process.
